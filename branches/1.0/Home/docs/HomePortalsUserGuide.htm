<h2>Overview<a name="overview"></a></h2>
<p>HomePortals is a free-form environment that allows you to create your own web pages by combining 
the functionality of individual elements called modules.</p>



<h2>Modules<a name="modules"></a></h2>
<p>Each HomePortals page is made up of one or more elements called "Modules". Modules provide certain 
functionalities, ranging from simple things such as displaying an image, or an RSS Feed, to more complex 
elements like a blog or ToDo list.</p>
<p>Modules can be used by themselves, or they can be combined via <a href="#events">Events</a> to achieve more complex functionalities.</p>
<p>All modules have certain attributes or parameters that can be used to configure their appearance and functionality. 
Some attributes, like the container title or location on the page are common to all modules in HomePortals, but others 
are specific to the module. For example, a module to display an RSS feed, may require the URL of the actual feed.</p>
<p>All module attributes can be set via the <a href="#controlpanel">Control Panel</a>.</p>
<p>Even though modules usually include a visual component that is displayed on the screen, some modules may provide 
some functionality that may not be directly visible. For example, a module can be used to apply a "skin" to a page, 
meaning that it can be used to alter the visual appearance of all the other modules.</p>
<p>In HomePortals, modules are actually a combination of several items, which may include CSS, Javascript, HTML, 
Server-side code and XML documents. However, by using the Control Panel, users may add or remove modules without 
having to worry about the individual files that compose each module.</p>


<h2>HomePortals Accounts<a name="accounts"></a></h2>
<p>HomePortals is a multi-user environment, meaning that individual users can have their own personal area which 
they can configure to their liking. Each user or "Account" has a small site in which they can create their own 
pages to fill with whatever content they want. All accounts are protected by a username and password, and have 
their own space on the server where they can store their pages. Users can access individual account sites 
directly by typing <em>http://&lt;your_server&gt;/accounts/&lt; account_name &gt;</em>.</p>
<p>Only the owner of the account is allowed to modify page contents, add new pages or delete existing pages.</p>
<p>Each page within an account can be either Private or Public. Public pages are visible by anyone that accesses 
the page and are displayed on the account's <a href="#sitemap">SiteMap</a>. Private pages may only be accessed by the account owner, 
and only after they have logged in with the account username and password. Private pages are only displayed 
on the sitemap after the owner has logged in.</p>

<h2>SiteMap<a name="sitemap"></a></h2>
<p>One of most important modules in a HomePortals page is the "SiteMap". This is the blue bar that appears on top 
of the screen on each HomePortals page. This module provides a navigation bar to quickly navigate through all 
of a user's pages. Also, the SiteMap gives access to the page's <a href="#controlpanel">Control Panel</a>. To access the Control Panel for 
the current page, just click on the big plus (+) sign on the right end of the SiteMap. This opens a panel where 
you can control several aspects of the current page.</p>

<h2>Control Panel<a name="controlpanel"></a></h2>
<p>The Control Panel is the place where you can control almost every aspect of the HomePortals page currently being 
displayed. You can access the Control Panel by making a click on the big plus (+) sign on the right end of the <a href="#sitemap">SiteMap</a>.</p>
<p>In order to make changes to a page using the Control Panel, you must be signed in as the owner of the account where 
the page is located. If you are not logged in, then you are prompted to enter the account's username and password. 
However, if you are logged in and you are not the account owner, then a message stating so is displayed.</p>
<p>Once you have access to the Control Panel, you will see a menu on the left side of the Control Panel with several 
options and tasks that you can perforn. The right side displays, by default, the selection of available modules 
that you can add to the current page. Modules are organized by <a href="#catalogs">Catalogs</a>. A catalog is just a collection of <a href="#modules">modules</a>, 
along with their description and other necessary information.</p>

<p>The options on the Control Panel are:</p>


<h3><a name="cp_addpage"></a>Add Page...</h3>
<p>This option allows you to add a new blank page to the current site. Just enter the name of the new page and click on 
the "Create Page" button.&nbsp; You will be automatically redirected to the new page.</p>
<p>You can also select from the list of published or shared pages stored on the registered catalogs. Refer to the<a href="#sharing">Sharing Pages</a> section for more information on this.</p>


<h3><a name="cp_configpage"></a>Config Page...</h3>
<p>This is perhaps one of the most complex areas of the Control Panel, because here you have very detailed control 
of the page structure and because of the potential to make the page stop working properly. Some knowledge of the 
structure of web pages is recommended before you attempt to modify any settings on this area.</p>
<p>The Config Page area is divided in five tabs: General, Stylesheets, Scripts, Layouts and Events.</p>

<p>The first tab, <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"><strong>General</strong></span>, allows you to change the 
title of the page. This is the text that appears on top of the browser's window whenever someone visits this 
page. Also, here you control whether the current page is a private or public page. To make a page private, 
that is, accessible only to you, then put a check on the checkbox next to the label "Private Page?". 
The change is made immediately. If the checkbox is clear, then it means that the page is public. Anyone that 
is not signed in as the account owner, will be redirected to the webserver's homepage.</p>

<p>The second tab, <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"><strong>Stylesheets</strong></span>, allows you to control 
all the CSS (Cascading StyleSheets) resources used by the current page. Here you have individual control of 
the stylesheets used. You can add, delete or modify the css files used by this page. Bear in mind that some 
modules add their own stylesheets to control their appearance, so modifying the current set of stylesheets will 
have an impact on how the page looks. When specifying a stylesheet to use, you only need to provide the URL of 
the css file. This can be a relative path to a file stored on the current server, or a full URL pointing to any 
accessible css file on another server.</p>

<p>The third tab, <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"><strong>Scripts</strong></span>, is used to control all 
Javascript files called by the current page. You can add, delete or modify Javascript files. Like with the 
stylesheets, please bear in mind that some modules require a particular Javascript file in order to work 
properly. Removing the reference to a file on the page may cause a module (or the entire page) to stop 
working properly.</p>

<p>The fourth tab, <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"><strong>Layouts</strong></span>, controls the layout 
sections of the current page. These are the individual sections in which you can place modules. There are 
three types of sections: headers, columns and footers. And are always displayed on that order in the page. 
However a page may have several headers, several columns and several footers (or none of any of them). 
Each layout section has a name, a type (header, column or footer) and a Class name. The Class name is optional 
and should be the name of any CSS class available on any of the included CSS resources for the page. The default 
style contains the following classes that may be used for layout sections: header, leftcolumn, middlecolumn, 
rightcolumn and footer. Modules are placed according to the layout section name in which they were placed. 
If you delete a layout section, or rename one to something different, then all modules formerly in that section 
will not be displayed on the page until you either change the module attributes to place them in a different layout 
section, or fix the modified layout section.</p>

<p>The fifth tab, <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-STYLE: italic">Events</span>, is perhaps the most interesting 
one. This is where you can define the interaction between existing modules. Each event entry on this tab contains three elements: An Object, and Event Name and the Event Handler. 
  The first two are used to indicate the event being raised, the first one tells who is raising the event 
  (i.e. Framework) and the second is the actual event ("PageLoaded"). The Event Handler is the function that will be called whenever the given event occurs. Read the <a href="#events">Events</a> section to learn more about HomePortals Events. </p>
<p>Changes to any of these areas will not cause an immediate reload to the current page, so you may have to use the "Reload Page" 
option on the Control Panel to see the effect of the changes you made.</p>

<h3><a name="cp_deletepage"></a>Delete This Page...</h3>
<p>Use this option to delete the current page. Please note that once you delete the page there is no way to 
undelete it. Deleting a page will not delete the modules contained in it, only the reference to them an the 
values of any settings stored. The actual data used by the module, like for blogs, todo lists, and calendars, 
will not be deleted if you delete the page.</p>

<h3><a name="cp_publishpage"></a>Publish Page...</h3>
<p>Publishing a page allows you to share the current page with other users. When you publish a page, it is added 
to a catalog where others can make copies of your page and add it to their sites. Please note that when you publish 
a page anyone will be able to make a exact copy of it, so please verify that there is nothing on the page that you 
do not want to share with others.</p>
<p>Certain modules, such as Blog, Appointments, and ToDo lists stores their data in files. Each of these modules have 
an attribute called URL used to indicate the path to this file. However, when this attribute is empty (as is by default), 
they will store their data on a file that is exclusive to the current account. This means that if you share a page that 
has any of these modules, and the URL is empty, then when the other user adds the page to their account, they will not 
be having access to your data file.</p>
<p>When you publish a page, you must enter a brief description for the page you want to share.</p>


<h3><a name="cp_editpage"></a>Edit Page XML...</h3>
<p>Each HomePortals page is represented by an XML document. This option allows you to view and/or modify the actual 
document for the page. Whenever you click on the "Save Changes" button, the document will be evaluated to see if it is 
a proper XML document. If it is not, then it will not be saved.</p>
<p>Please be very careful when editing this XML document, as you may cause the current page to be completely unusable 
and the HomePortals server will not be able to display the page at all.</p>


<h3><a name="cp_configmodules"></a>Config Modules...</h3>
<p>This option is used to configure the attributes for all modules on the current page. When you click on this option, 
you view a list of all modules on the page, sorted by the container's title and the module id in parenthesis. 
Click on the module title to access the module attributes.</p>
<p>Module attributes are divided in two sections: <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Base Attributes</span> a
nd <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Other Attributes</span>. The first section are attributes common to all 
HomePortals modules. The following table describes all base attributes.</p>

<table border=0 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 style="WIDTH: 511px;">
  <tbody>
    <tr bgcolor=#cccccc>
      <th width=28%>Attribute Name:</th>
      <th width=72%>Description:</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> Title:</td>
      <td> Container's title</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> Location:</td>
      <td> Name of the layout location where the module will be displayed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"> Name</td>
      <td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"> Name of the actual module.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"> Display:</td>
      <td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"> Indicates the initial state of the module's container: normal, collapsed or hidden.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"> Container:</td>
      <td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"> Indicates whether the module will be displayed inside a container or not.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"> Output:</td>
      <td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"> Indicates whether the output of the module will be displayed on the screen or not.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"> Show Print:</td>
      <td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"> Controls whether to display the icons on the container's header or not.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"> CSS Styles:</td>
      <td style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: top"> CSS style rules to apply to the module contents.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Other Attributes</span> section contains any other attribute that is specific to 
this module. By changing the values of these attributes is how you configure how the module will behave on the current 
page.</p>
<p>You may also access this settings page directly for individual modules by clicking on the <img src=/home/common/images/isettings.gif width="20" height="20" title="Edit Module Settings Icon"> icon 
that appears on the title bar of the module's container.</p> 
<p>Also, the module settings page allows you to delete a module from the page. This will only remove the reference 
to the module and not the module itself, however, the values you entered for all attributes will be lost. To delete 
a module, only click on the "Delete Module" button.</p>

<h3><a name="cp_addmodules"></a>Add Modules...</h3>
<p>Use this option to add modules to the current page. This is the default screen displayed whenever accessing 
the Control Panel through the SiteMap. This screen displays a list of all modules available on the registered 
catalogs. Refer to the <a href="#catalogs">Catalogs</a> section for more information.</p>
<p>This screen allows you to select a module from the available catalogs, subscribe to new catalogs and remove catalogs 
from your site.</p>
<p>To add a module, click on the module name. The description of the module will be displayed, you will also need to 
select the layout section of the page where you want to place the module. You may change the location of the module 
at a later time too. To confirm the addition of the module to the page, click on the "Yes" button. Click on "No" 
to return to the Add Modules page.</p>
<p>To subscribe to other catalogs, enter the catalog URL using the space provided below the "Add Catalog URL:" label. 
The screen will now display all modules available on the new catalog.</p>
<p>To remove a catalog from your site, click on the "Remove This Catalog" link below the module name. Removing the 
catalog will not affect existing modules.</p>

<h3><a name="cp_reloadpage"></a>Reload Page</h3>
<p>This option closes the Control Panel and refreshes the current page.</p>

<h3><a name="cp_logoff"></a>Log Off</h3>
<p>Signs you off from your account and redirects you to your public page.</p>


<h2>Catalogs<a name="catalogs"></a></h2>
<p>In HomePortals modules are grouped into catalogs. Catalogs are documents that contains references to a collection 
of modules along with their description and other information. Each account starts with a single catalog, which contains 
a set of default modules available to any page within the account's site. However, you may subscribe to more catalogs, 
expanding this way the modules available to you.</p>

<p>Currently there are only two modules available:<br>
<ul>
  <li> Default (/home/modules/content/catalog.xml') - This is the module included by default.</li>
  <li> Skins (/home/modules/skins/skins.xml') - Contains modules used to "skin" a page.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Events<a name="sharing"></a></h2>
<p>Certain actions in modules trigger "Events". For example, selecting a date on a calendar module triggers the 
"calendar.OnSelectDate" event. On the other hand, some modules have actions or commands that they can perform. 
For example, an appointments module has a command to make it load all appointments for a given date. </p>
<p>The Events tab allows you to link an event raised by   one module (i.e. A user clicking on a date) with an 
action performed by another module (i.e. displaying all appointments for the given date). The action performed in 
response to raised event is called the "Event Hander". In this area you may enter all relations between events raised 
and event handlers. What events are raised and the name of the event handlers are specific to individual modules. 
Refer to each module's documentation for more information on its events. </p>
<p>There is also a global event that is raised everytime a HomePortals page finishes loading: "Framework.PageLoaded". 
This is useful when you want certain actions to be performed as soon as the page finishes loading. </p>
<p>The parameters or information passed by the raised event to the event handler is specific to each module.</p>

<h2>Sharing Pages<a name="sharing"></a></h2>
<p>Publishing a page allows you to share the current page with other users. When you publish a page, it is added 
to a catalog where others can make copies of your page and add it to their sites. See <a href="#cp_publishpage">Publish Page...</a> under the Control Panel section for more information on how to share a page with other users.</p>

					<title>Designers Needed!</title>

					As you may have probably guessed, we, the developers of HomePortals, are no 
DaVincis nor Picassos, furthermore, you could even say that we are "artistically-challenged", 
for that reason we ask the talented and gifted people out there to help us by
contributing their inspiration. We are looking for new skins to add to the skins library 
so that people can customize their pages. Of course you will have all the credit for 
your design. If you are interested, please contact us at &lt;a href="mailto:info@cfempire.com"&gt;info@cfempire.com&lt;/a&gt;
and we'll send you more information about how to create HomePortals skins. Thanks!

					&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would like to let everyone know that we are currently developing the 
new version of HomePortals, both the underlying engine and the public 
HomePortals website. The plans are to address all concerns and do a 
major redesign of everything, applying the lessons learn from our experience 
with the current HomePortals version. For this reason, we would like all of 
you to send us your requests for what would you like to see in the next 
HomePortals version: modules, functionality, anything.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send your comments and requests to 
&lt;a href="mailto:info@cfempire.com"&gt;info@cfempire.com&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

					<title>Control Panel Updated</title>
					<link>http://www.homeportals.net/Home/Modules/Blog/blog.cfc?method=getPost&amp;URL=/Accounts/wencho/blog.xml&amp;timestamp=2006-06-02T18:22:50</link>

					&lt;p&gt;After a long silence, I've come to announce that we now have a brand-new and completely redesigned control panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who don't know, the HomePortals Control Panel is a mini application that allows you to manage your HomePortals pages. From the control panel you can add or remove modules, change page attributes and do a great deal of configuration tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new version of the control panel aims to simplify common tasks (as adding modules and rearranging the page layout) without removing access to more advanced tasks (such as managin event handlers and linked resources).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very "Web2.0" feature that we added was a way to re-arrange page modules just by dragging around with the mouse. If you've looked at some of the "AJAX start pages" that exist around the web (i.e. google, netvibes, etc) you've seen this behavior. In HomePortals we have implmented the drag and drop functionality in a different way, instead of rearranging the modules directly on the page, you do it on the control panel. When you open the control panel in the "modules" section - which is the default when you click on the Add Content button - you can see a scaled view of the entire page, with the modules represented as boxes. You can drag around this boxes between the different regions of the page (colums, headers and/or footers). From this view you can also directly add more modules to the page and then place them wherever you want them. We adopted this approach for a few reasons: First, even though it looks like one, HomePortals is NOT an "Ajax startpage". HomePortals is more resembles a personal content management system, or portal, that you can use to create any type of website or webapplication you want. With that in mind, if you organize your modules in a particular way, you may not want your visitors to start rearranging everything for you. Also, we believe that by showing page owners a bird's eye view of the entire page, we provide them with a more effective and practical way to manage the page layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another change on the new Control Panel, is that we reorgnized pretty much all of its sections and grouped them into 3 main groups: Site, Page, and Modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Modules&lt;/b&gt; section, as explained before, is where you define the layout of the page, add new modules and also configure each module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Page&lt;/b&gt; section is where you set page-wide settings, such as the page name, the skin, whether the page is your default page for your site, and whether it is a private page. Also, from here you can access more advanced settings like stylesheets and scripts used. From here you can also change the page name. The page name is what will be displayed on the site map bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Site&lt;/b&gt; section is used for tasks that involve your entire site. When you access this section, you can view a list of all the pages on your site, and whether they are private or not, and which one is your default page. Also, from this list you can either delete pages or publish them. From the Site section you can also add more pages to your site, and manage the catalogs. Catalogs are directories from where you can add more modules or skins to your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, another change is that when you add new pages to your site, now you have the option to copy an existing page from your site. The options to create a new blank page, and add a published page are still there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you like the changes we made, and of course we'd really really really like to hear some feedback so we can improve HomePortals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

					<title>New Module: TextPad</title>
					<link>http://www.homeportals.net/Home/Modules/Blog/blog.cfc?method=getPost&amp;URL=/Accounts/wencho/blog.xml&amp;timestamp=2006-04-19T19:10:57</link>

					&lt;p&gt;This post is to announce the latest addition to the HomePortals modules library. The new module is called &lt;b&gt;TextPad&lt;/b&gt; and is a variation of the EditBox module. The TextPad as it name implies, allows you to enter different text entries that you can display on any of your pages. It is in fact very similar to the editBox module, they even store the content you enter on the same file. the difference is that the textPad is far more user-friendly since it uses the excellent editor &lt;a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/"&gt;TinyMCE&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.moxiecode.com/"&gt;Moxiecode Systems&lt;/a&gt;. TinyMCE is, if not the best, then one of the best WYSIWYG HTML editors out there, and kudos to Moxiecode for releasing it as an open source project, under the LGPL licence.&lt;/p&gt;

Here is screenshot of how the new module looks when you are signed-in to your page:
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.homeportals.net/home/modules/textPad/Images/textPad.gif"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Any visitor to your page (or you if you are not signed-in) would only see the actual text that you created, but will not be able to edit it. Like in the editBox module, you can use the control panel to indicate which text entry will be displayed when someone looks at the page. This is done by specifying the "contentID" attribute and setting it to the title of the text entry you want to display. If you leave this attribute empty, your visitors will see a list with all text entries created and will be able to look at each one of them. Note that this only happens when you leave the contentID empty, if you select a text entry to display, then your visitors will not be able to browse around your text entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the editBox, you can create as many text entries you want. You can even use this module to create multiple entries and design your site this way, it only requires a little imagination.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

					<title>New Module: ZoomClouds</title>
					<link>http://www.homeportals.net/Home/Modules/Blog/blog.cfc?method=getPost&amp;URL=/Accounts/wencho/blog.xml&amp;timestamp=2006-04-12T17:20:32</link>

					&lt;p&gt;It's been a while but finally there is a new addition to our modules library, and in the best tradition of web2.0 and HomePortals, this is a module that lets you interact with other online services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time it's ZoomClouds' turn. For those who don't know what is ZoomClouds, it is an excellent website/service that creates Tag Clouds based on an RSS feed that you provide (tag clouds are a cool way of displaying several tags and at the same time indicating their relevance or weight). What is best of their service, is not only that it is free but it also lets you display your tag clouds in your own website or blog. And now, it also plays with HomePortals. With the new ZoomClouds module, you can add your zoom clouds to your page, or any zoom cloud for that matter; you only need to add the module to your page and enter the name of the cloud you wish to display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For more information, head over to the ZoomClouds website at &lt;a href="http://www.zoomclouds.com/"&gt;http://www.zoomclouds.com/&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;There was a bug on the "Send Feedback" feature of the Control Panel that was not allowing people to send their comments and report bugs to us. That bug has been fixed now.&lt;/p&gt;

					<title>HomePortals Upgrade</title>
					<link>http://www.homeportals.net/Home/Modules/Blog/blog.cfc?method=getPost&amp;URL=/Accounts/wencho/blog.xml&amp;timestamp=2006-03-30T15:02:58</link>

You may have noticed that the HomePortals site was down today for a few hours. What we were doing was upgrading our site to the new version of the HomePortals Server (the actual software that powers this website), as of today we are running version 1.3 of HomePortals. I'll describe some of the new features and changes on the new version:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first change you will notice is the SiteMap, it has been modified to make it look better and be more user-friendly. We added some links and controls for commonly used functionality so that users don't have to go digging through menus to find how to do something to their sites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have also noticed that your pages no longer contain the SiteMap as a module; this is because of a new feature in HomePortals Server. This new version allows us to define modules that will always be included on user's pages without the user having to worry about them. This way we can show the SiteMap and Google AdWords  on fixed positions at the beginning and end of the page. This is a great feature for branding your own HomePortals installation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another new feature in this version is the ability of account owners to select their "Default" page. A default page is the page that is displayed whenever you login to your account or access your account directly by the URL. Now you can select any of your pages as your default page. However this functionality is only available for accounts created using the new version of HomePortals, although we are working on a patch to provide this functionality to already existing accounts. To set a page as your default page, go to the page you want to use as default, then go to Settings in the Control Panel, and you will see a checkbox for Default Page, just make sure it is checked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally another feature in this version is the addition of HomePortals Administration Plugins support. The HomePortals Administrator is a small application that allows administrators to manage general settings about their HomePortals installation. Version 1.3 has support to extend the administrator via plugins. For example plugins can be developed to manage general settings of a particular module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to do this upgrade we had to do some changes in all account pages (remove the siteMap module), so if you are experiencing any problems with your pages or something is not right; please let us know via the HomePortals Forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, we are now working on version 1.4 so if you have any ideas and requests for things you would like to see, please let us know too!
&lt;/p&gt;

					<title>Calling All Developers!</title>
					<link>http://www.homeportals.net/Home/Modules/Blog/blog.cfc?method=getPost&amp;URL=/Accounts/wencho/blog.xml&amp;timestamp=2006-03-09T22:08:08</link>
					<description>
					
					&lt;p&gt;Finally we got around to post a short tutorial describing how to create and extend HomePortals!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently we only provide a tutorial that shows the basics of creating a HomePortals modules, we expect to post a second tutorial that goes more deeply into how to use all the features that HomePortals offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to invite any developer to participate creating their modules, and let us know if you have any questions or if there is anything else you think would make the module creation process any easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the new developer's section 
&lt;a href="http://www.homeportals.net/home.cfm?currentHome=/accounts/homeportals/layouts/developers.xml"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;

					<title>New Skin</title>

					Hello, this is just a quick note to let everyone know that there is a new skin available: "Silver". It is also another rounded corners skin but with a nice little gradient on the title bar. I hope you like it.

					<title>Bookmarks2 Module Updated</title>
					<link>http://www.homeportals.net/Home/Modules/Blog/blog.cfc?method=getPost&amp;URL=/Accounts/wencho/blog.xml&amp;timestamp=2006-02-22T11:57:16</link>

					Sorry that it has been a while since I posted any updates in this blog, but I have been busy mostly at work (sad to me to say that HomePortals is not my full-time job), and also with a bit of HomePortals stuff.

&lt;p&gt;However, today I managed to upload an update to the Bookmarks2 module; I have updated the user interface to make it a bit more polished and nice for editing. Here is a screenshot of the new look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://wencho.homeportals.net/Accounts/wencho/Images/bookmarks2_module.gif" /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Basically I got rid of the ugly "Click Here For Edit" link on top, and replaced it with two icons for editing and deleting entries; these icons are only visible when you are logged in as the page owner. There were a couple of other fixes, but they were mostly internal stuff. If anybody has a problem, please don't hesitate to send me an email using the control panel or the forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it for now, keep playing and I hope to have more announcements shortly...&lt;/p&gt;

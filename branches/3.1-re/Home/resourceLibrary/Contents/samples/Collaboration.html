<h1>
  HomePortals As A Collaboration Site
</h1>
<br/>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">Purpose</span>:<br/>
Discuss how HomePortals can be used (and/or extended or modifed) by a group of
people to collaborate on a common project.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">Problem:</span><br style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold"/>
When several people have to work on a common project they usually have a set of
common resources related to the project at hand. These resources include:<br/>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT:40px">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Text documents
      <li>
        Tasks lists
        <li>
          Calendars &amp; Appointments
          <li>
            Images
            <li>
              Links to related sites (i.e. company websites, blogs, etc)
              <li>
                Files (i.e. Word, Excel, Powerpoint documents)
  </ul>
</div>
<br/>
Group members require a way of sharing these common resources and information
about the project. When the group is geographically dispersed, this is usually
handled by each member communicating in person, phone, or email. Also, some of
the common resources may be stored on one or more agreed websites where all
group members can get to them.&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
Although having all resources stored in a centralized location may be a more
desirable situation, there may be reasons why this is not possible or practical:<br/>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT:40px">
  1. Some resources are better suited for certain sites (i.e. flickr for storing
  pictures, del.icio.us for storing links, etc) than other,<br/>
  2. Group members may already be using a particular site and it would be too
  cumbersome to replicate that data or move it to another site.<br/>
</div>
<br/>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">HomePortals
Solution:</span><br style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold"/>
HomePortals offers a unique alternative for groups of people working on a common
project. The characteristics of HomePortals provides an environment in which
team members can collaborate and have a centralized place from where they can
access common resources that may reside anywhere on the Internet.<br/>
<br/>
The current HomePortals implementation would require that all team members share
a single account per project, this is because the limitation that HomePortals
enforces in which only the account owner can modify data files. Other accounts
would be able to look at the project's data files but not be allowed to make
changes. However, it would be a desirable trait to have each group member to
have his/her own HomePortals account, and have read/write access to data from a
pool of shared content.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ffcc33">This would require a change in
HomePortals to allow a restricted group of people to work on the same data
files; also there needs to be a way of letting them know what data files are
available for sharing, as well as information about each file. They need to be
able to create their own catalog, also this catalog needs to be able to not only
indicate modules but also data files, along with information about what module
needs to be used to open it, and information about its purpose, description and
creation.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR:#ffcc33">Also when editing the data in shared
modules there should be some kind of safeguard to avoid users overwriting each
other. Currently once a module is loaded, its data is copied to the session
scope and once a change is made, the entire data file is saved (instead of
saving only the changed data items). This is dangerous in the sense that if user
A loads the module, then user B loads it too, then user A makes a change while B
still has the data in memory; A's change is saved, but since B hasn't reload the
page, the moment B makes a change, then he will "undo" A's change.</span><br/>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold"><br/>
Scenario:</span><br style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold"/>
Jack and Gill are working on a new project for their company.<br/>
This project is about a new product called XYZ.<br/>
Jack and Gill create each their own HomePortals account.<br/>
Gill creates a new catalog called "ProjectXYZ"<br/>
Jack subscribes to this catalog<br/>
Whenever Jack or Gill creates a new module, they publish it to the ProjectXYZ
catalog so it can be shared with the other<br/>
Each one creates their pages as they see fit, adding only the modules and data
files that they need at a given time<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">Required Changes:</span><br/>
<ul>
  <li>
    Shared catalogs
    <li>
      Elements published to a catalog must be persistent, regardless of their
      presence on the publishers site
</ul>

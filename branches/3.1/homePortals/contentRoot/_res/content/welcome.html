<h1 style="font-size:18px;margin:0px">Welcome To HomePortals</h1>

<p>HomePortals is a ColdFusion framework that allows developers to build rich and modular
web applications by combining existing reusable resources into a single page.
</p>
<p>HomePortals provides a runtime engine that processes documents called 
HomePortals Pages that provide information as to what resources to include on
a page and how to organize them.
</p>
<p>Additionally, it provides a simple yet powerful API for developing
"modules" that can be embedded within a page. 
Modules can range from the very basic (simple static html content) to 
full fledged AJAX powered mini applications.
</p>
<p>HomePortals provides an extensive set of tools and features that allow 
developers to create multiple types of applications like start pages, personal
portals, social networking sites, intranet portals and more.

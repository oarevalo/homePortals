-------------------------
- Modified gateway.cfm template to allow override of reference to HomePortals application instance variable. If
the instance is anywhere other than application.homePortals, you can set the variable HOMEPORTALS_INSTANCE to 
reference the actual instance before doing the <cfinclude> for gateway.cfm

- Added method getHomePortals() to moduleController. This allows modules to obtain a reference to the current
homePortals application in which they are being executed. From this instance they can access any part of the HomePortals
environment.

- Modified login, contentBox, htmlBox and RSSReader modules to use the getHomePortals() method instead of using
 direct references to application.homeportals

- Modified cacheManager so that it can used as a <cfinclude> like page.cfm and gateway.cfm. Can also accept the 
variable HOMEPORTALS_INSTANCE to override the default location of the HomePortals application instance variable.

- When adding a page resource to a site the new page has the name of the page resource added instead of just being
named 'copy of xxx', unless the name property of the resource is blank.

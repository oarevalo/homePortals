-------------------------
	07/21/08
-------------------------
- added getSite method to accounts.cfc
- improved debug.cfm and cacheManager.cfm tools. Added control for resetting application and reloading current page
to debug.cfm. Debug now shows cache information. Added JVM free memory stats to both
- removed siteTemplate setting. The site.xml file is now autogenerated when a site information is first requested

-------------------------
	07/20/08
-------------------------
- Removed secondary file-based cache from RSSService component, now only uses a one level in memory cache of feeds.
- RSS Cache can now be configured from the main HomePortals config. The rss cache is now initialized when the Engine starts up.
- Resources are no longer fully indexed at application startup time, they are indexed in memory as they are needed. This
improves application startup time. Full indexing is still available programmatically.
- Added default css class SectionSettings for config views of modules, modified modules to use the new class.

-------------------------
	07/16/08
-------------------------
- Email address is no longer required when creating/updating accounts. All account fields can now be
used when creating an account.

-------------------------
	07/05/08
-------------------------
- Fixed bug in EpochCalendar module that prevented the onSelectDate event to be detected

-------------------------
	07/04/08
-------------------------
- Modified cache registry to allow concurrent access to individual caches (before all cache access was single-threaded)
- added contentStore caching to be managed by the cacheRegistry

-------------------------
	07/02/08
-------------------------
- Added HomePortalsProxy component. This allows for remote interaction with the HomePortals instance on an
application. To enable remote access on an application, create a component on the application that extends
Home.Components.homePortalsProxy and override the variables APP_ROOT and HOMEPORTALS_INSTANCE_VAR as needed.

- Added method reinit() to Home.Components.homePortals to reinitialize the application instance without 
having to discard it.

-------------------------
	06/30/08
-------------------------
- Modified gateway.cfm template to allow override of reference to HomePortals application instance variable. If
the instance is anywhere other than application.homePortals, you can set the variable HOMEPORTALS_INSTANCE to 
reference the actual instance before doing the <cfinclude> for gateway.cfm

- Added method getHomePortals() to moduleController. This allows modules to obtain a reference to the current
homePortals application in which they are being executed. From this instance they can access any part of the HomePortals
environment.

- Modified login, contentBox, htmlBox and RSSReader modules to use the getHomePortals() method instead of using
 direct references to application.homeportals

- Modified cacheManager so that it can used as a <cfinclude> like page.cfm and gateway.cfm. Can also accept the 
variable HOMEPORTALS_INSTANCE to override the default location of the HomePortals application instance variable.

- When adding a page resource to a site the new page has the name of the page resource added instead of just being
named 'copy of xxx', unless the name property of the resource is blank.
